# NightCitySubnet
This is a .net website for campaign meta-data and lore for the Player Characters, as well as a CTF for a homebrewed Cyberpunk Red campaign.

*"Whats up Chooms! Here is easy access to the Night City subnet via a simulated public terminal. Pretty preem soft if you ask me. Boost your netrunning and tech skills and get all the current news and events goin' on. Just, uh... Keep watch for the Voodoo Boys when you use it alright? Don't want to tango with them if you don't need to... Unless you got ICE stronger than diamonds and the hellhounds to back it!*
